## Harvestify

Harvestify is a machine learning project developed using Python that focuses on crop  detection, crop area-based recommendations, and crop and leaf disease detection. The project makes use of data sets provided by Kaggle to train various machine learning models that can accurately identify different crops and their associated diseases.

The crop detection feature of Harvestify allows users to identify the type of crop that is present in an image. This can be particularly useful for farmers or agricultural researchers who need to quickly identify crops in a given area. Additionally, the crop area-based recommendation feature uses machine learning algorithms to recommend which crop would be most suitable to grow in a given area based on factors such as soil type, climate, and other environmental factors.

Another key feature of Harvestify is its crop and leaf disease detection capability. By analyzing images of crops and leaves, the project can accurately detect various diseases that may be affecting the plant. This can be particularly useful for farmers who need to quickly identify and treat diseased crops to prevent further spread.

Overall, Harvestify is a powerful machine learning tool that can provide valuable insights into crop detection, crop area-based recommendations, and crop and leaf disease detection. Its accurate and efficient algorithms make it a valuable tool for farmers, researchers, and anyone involved in the agricultural industry.
